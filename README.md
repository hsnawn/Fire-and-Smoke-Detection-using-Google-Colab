# Fire-and-Smoke-Detection-using-Google-Colab

This project is created using the tutorial “Fire and smoke detection with Keras and Deep Learning” at pyimagesearch.com by Adrian Rosebrock. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Ali Shafique, who modified the code by Adrian Rosebrock in Google Colab and uploaded it to his Github repository. 

The main improvements are the dataset cleansing and the addition of thousands of more relevant images to the dataset. Some other improvements include changing the optimizer, the addition of the Tensor Board, and saving the model and architecture to a single file.

These changes improved the accuracy of the model from 0.89 to 0.97, which is the best accuracy for this project.
